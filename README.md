# READ ME

Currently this is just me messing around with Kotlin and Compose for Desktop.

## Database
It requires a postgres database to work. Schema in sql_schema.

**Note**: I'm only going to be uploading a full schema file at this point, as I'm still developing this, and things might
change. 

## Things to do
Crud the things


### Projects
employees to projects
notes / Comments
budget
Status - Red/Amber/Green
Priority
Due Date
background information about project. Where did it comes. Why are we doing this, etc?
tasks to project
Project Team?
Progress

### Employee
Holiday tracking


## Possible ideas
Nice Timeline/calendar view for employee allocation start/end against project
Generate reports


## Would be brilliant to have
Integration into tools such as JIRA and those types of things
multi db support
Authentication/Authorisation
